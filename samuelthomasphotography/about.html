            <p>When starting high school my grandma kindly offered her broken camera for my birthday if I simply repaired it. Since then I have shared my journeys and thank her through the photographs she blessed me with the tool to seek!</p>

            <p>While I have always had a love of nature and light photography, I have always strived for the opportunity to deepen my skills with photographing people and those around me - the best part of our lives.</p>

            <p>I took photography classes through high school where I found the opportunity to see the sights we often miss as I roamed the campus looking for new photos in each hallway and window. This is where I mastered adjusting my camera for the perfect outcome as I learned to use the tools of Lightroom and Photoshop.</p>

            <p>All throughout my missionary service from 2021-2023 I took the opportunities that I could to photograph along the way. Here I really got to sharpen my skills with photographing people. Since being home and now studying in Rexburg, Idaho at BYUI for a minor in photography, I have photographed any adventure along the way. And I'm ready to photograph how you would like to be seen, and what you would like to always remember.</p>
