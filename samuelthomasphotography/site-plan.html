        About Me
          When starting high school my grandma kindly offered her broken camera for my birthday if I simply repaired it. Since then I have shared my journeys and thank her through the photographs she blessed me with the tool to seek!
            <img src="" alt="Me and my grandma!">
          While I have always had a love of nature and light photography, I have always strived for the opportunity to deepen my skills with photographing people and those around me - the best part of our lives.
            <img src="" alt="light photography">
            <img src="" alt="my brothers">
          I took photography classes through high school where I found the opportunity to see the sights we often miss as I roamed the campus looking for new photos in each hallway and window. This is where I mastered adjusting my camera for the perfect outcome as I learned to use the tools of Lightroom and Photoshop.
            <img src="" alt="reflective hallway window portrait">
            <img src="" alt="photoshop lock screen">
          All throughout my missionary service from 2021-2023 I took the opportunities that I could to photograph along the way. Here I really got to sharpen my skills with photographing people. Since being home and now studying in Rexburg, Idaho at BYUI for a minor in photography, I have photographed any adventure along the way. And I'm ready to photograph how you would like to be seen, and what you would like to always remember.

          Locations: <br>
           I will happily travel up to 2.5 hours to meet for a photoshoot. If over an hour away there is a $10 travel fee. I will be at the following locations throughout the year:
           <br>January 10th - July 15th: Rexburg, Idaho and surrounding areas
           <br>July 20th - September 12th: Cumming, Georgia and surrounding areas
           <br>September 15th - December 5th: Rexburg, Idaho and surrounding areas
           <br>December 8th - January 8th: Cumming, Goergia and surrounding areas
